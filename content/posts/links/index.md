Several projects that I feel are helpful for learning within a smaller boundary.
On the web development side there are countless examples.

[Robocode](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/)
- A cool intersection of code and trigonometry. Code a robot tank, and using its sensors
defeat the others in the arena.

[Greeps](https://www.greenfoot.org/competition/greeps/)
- I was assigned this project when I was in 12th Grade for AP CS. Given some limitations, design the "brain" of a swarm of tomato loving aliens to collect as many as possible.

[Elevator Saga](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/)
- Design the logic for an elevator based on an existing API. Written in Javascript.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
- Annual series of coding challenges that happen around the holidays. Many established developers
use these to refine their current knowledge, or to learn a new programming language's features.
