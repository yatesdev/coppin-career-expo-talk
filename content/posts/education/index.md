### So you like working with computers? 

Awesome, what aspect interests you?

- Theory?
  - Simulations
  - Data modeling / machine learning

- Application?
  - Development

### Experiences I can pass along

- Learning a programming language is fun and can be an awesome side project to learn, but the most bang for your buck would be learning to break your projects down into small, solveable problems.
  - Once you know your problems, you can pick a language that fits best.
    - I.E. While Assembly language is incredibly fast, if I'm making a program that is taking user input, odds are that the performance benefits are greatly offset by the time to write and debug such a low level language.

    <!-- Python and JS discussion from the syllabus, how do you like Python? JS? Explain how they are both high level dynamically typed >

- Web Development has become so much more than just a static webpage
  - Web apps are dynamic, where you have developers who can specialize in just the HTML/JS/CSS aspect, others who specialize in communication between the website and a database.
