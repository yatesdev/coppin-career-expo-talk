### Expectations / Skills

- Problem Solving
  - Be able to solve abstract technical problems with composable systems
  - Structure logic in a coherent manner
  <!-- Coming up with a solution to most problems is the easy part, making it work
   in a larger system or make it simple for others to understand is a whole other level-->

- Communication
  <!--Software Engineering is communication on many levels, both human to human and human to computer, and even computer to computer-->
  - Take technical problems and be able to explain them in terms non technical coworkers can understand.
  - Inter-team discussions around implementations and their effects on other systems
  <!--I'd much rather work with a team of average engineers with great communication skills,
  than a team of amazing engineers who can not communicate well-->

- Reading
  - Code is read about 10x as often as it is written
  - Keeping up to date with current technologies and solutions
  <!--Some of the systems I learned on 10 years ago, aren't current anymore-->
  - My job some days is being a professional Googler
  <!---->

<!-- Notice how I didn't mention programming as a skill? If you have the core basics (problem solving/distill problems) you can extrapolate them to all of your work. Almost all languages operate with the same core logic, so once you learn that, learning the language becomes secondary. ChatGPT and other AI can only get you so far, and if you are just starting, I'd stay
well away from them. They inhibit the learning stage.-->

### Daily Schedule

What does my day look like?

Every company/organization operates differently... with different expectations.

- Morning Status meeting (15min)
  <!-- Basically homeroom-->
- Sometimes a follow on discussion afterward (0-45min)
- Code/Focus time (5-6hrs)

<!-- Discuss the distinction of remote work. Compare with non remote-->
<!-- Pros of the flexibility. Cons of the flexibility-->

- You become your family's tech support guy.
